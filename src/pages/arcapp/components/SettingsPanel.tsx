 * As of 2026-10-26, this is deliberately NOT the home for most settings anymore — each module
 * (Checklists, Issues, Joint Packs, NETA Tracker, Submittals) has its own collapsed-by-default
 * "Settings" section on its own page now (ModuleSettingsSection.tsx), configuring just that
 * module. What's left here is specifically what doesn't belong to one module:
 *
 *  - CxAlloy project override — used by both Checklist and Issue deep links (and Equipment
 *    Tracker auto-detection), not any one of them.
 *  - Each module's own enable/disable toggle (Joint Pack Photos / Asset Attributes / NETA
 *    Tracker) — has to live here rather than on the module's own page, since that page (and its
 *    Sidebar nav item) doesn't exist to show the toggle on while it's off. Everything else about
 *    those modules (script URLs, folder IDs, To-Do settings) moved to their own pages, since
 *    those only matter once you can already reach the page.
 *  - Workflows — has no page of its own to live on.
 *  - Authorized Users — app-wide access control, not a module.
