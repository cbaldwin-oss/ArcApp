 * Which LaunchPad project (site) ArcApp is currently scoped to — STY4 (Phoenix DC3) or SANNT1B

 * lifetime — switching projects (setCurrentProject) writes the choice to localStorage and reloads
 * the page, rather than trying to make every fetch/hook in the app reactive to a live project
 * change. That keeps this a plain constant every plain function in api.ts can read synchronously
 * (no React context, no stale-closure risk), at the cost of a page reload on switch — an
 * acceptable trade for an action taken rarely (picking which site you're working on), not per
 * click.

/**
 * Capability gaps found while wiring up SAN-NT1B, requiring manual setup on the LaunchPad/Sheet
 * side that this app can't do for you — pages depending on either show an "unavailable for this
 * project" notice instead of silently erroring or (worse) rendering broken data:
 *
 *  - `siteLogging`: Tamper Seals and RTFT write to <prefix>Assets/<prefix>RTFT — those tables
 *    only exist for STY4 today.
 *  - `cxAlloyActions`: Checklists, Issues, Asset Attributes (+ its photo-crop OCR), and the
 *    Checklist/Issue To-Do sections all call custom actions (getChecklists/getIssues/
 *    getCxAlloySettings/getEquipmentAttributes/saveAttributes/saveImageOnly/ocrImage) that were
 *    added specifically to STY4's Apps Script deployment (see the "ADDED FOR ArcApp" block
 *    mentioned in api.ts) — SAN-NT1B's separately-deployed script doesn't have them yet, so an
 *    unrecognized `action` param there currently falls through to a different, equipment-tracker-
 *    shaped default response instead of an error, which would otherwise render as a page full of
 *    blank/malformed rows rather than fail cleanly.
 *
 * NETA Tracker used to be a third capability here (`netaTracker`) but moved to a per-project
 * Settings toggle instead (`netaTrackerEnabled` in AppSettings, `neta_tracker_enabled` in
 * arcapp_settings — see api.ts/SettingsPanel.tsx) as of 2026-09-25, by request: unlike the two
 * gaps above, NETA Tracker's Sheet/script is a brand-new per-site build every time (not just "add
 * an action to an existing script"), so an admin turning it on for a newly-onboarded site
 * shouldn't need a code change and redeploy of ArcApp itself.
